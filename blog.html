          <p class="ml-5">
            In modern JavaScript development, it is recommended to use let and const over var due to their block-scoping behavior, which helps prevent variable leakage and makes code more predictable. Use const when the value of a variable should never change and let when you expect the variable to change during its scope. Understanding the scope of these declarations is crucial for writing clean and bug-free JavaScript code..</p>

          <p class="ml-5">
            'undefined' typically represents unintentional or automatic absence of a value, often resulting from uninitialized variables or missing properties, while 'null' is used to explicitly indicate the absence of a value or to reset a variable or property to an empty state. It's important to use these values appropriately in your code to convey your intentions and avoid potential bugs related to missing or uninitialized data.

          <h2 class="text-2xl mt-5 ml-5">What do you mean by REST API?:</h2>
          <p class="ml-5">REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing networked applications. It is a style of web services that is based on the principles of simplicity, scalability, and statelessness.

            Here are some key characteristics and principles of REST APIs:
            
            Statelessness: In a RESTful system, each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store any information about the client's state between requests. This makes REST APIs highly scalable and easy to manage.
            
            Resources: In REST, everything is treated as a resource, which can be an object, data, or service. Each resource is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).
            
            HTTP Methods: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources. The most common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:
            
            GET: Retrieve data from the server.
            POST: Create a new resource on the server.
            PUT: Update an existing resource on the server.
            DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
            Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or plain text. Clients can request the representation they prefer by specifying the appropriate content type in the request header.
            
            Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a uniform and consistent interface, which simplifies interactions between clients and servers. This consistency makes it easier for developers to understand and use the API.</p>
